<p>Hello, my name is Bret Edward Hazelwood. A little about me is I have 2 siblings, an older brother and a younger sister. I also have 2 dogs. I am a first-year student in the Graphic Design program at Algonquin College. I am 18 years old and have a lot of hobbies including, drawing, painting, video editing, and researching tanks. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed art and graphic design. I won 3 art awards and led the yearbook for 2 years in high school. I also took Communication Technologies for 3 years which introduced me to adobe products. </p>

<p>Now I couldn't think of anything else to talk about so here is a little bit about my favorite tank the Leopard 1. The Leopard 1 is a German main battle tank designed by Porsche in the 1960s. It was made with little armor because at the time it was thought the HEAT round would make armor almost obsolete and it was armed with a L7 British rifled gun. It is my favorite talk because of its fast nimble design, it reminds me of myself. </p>
